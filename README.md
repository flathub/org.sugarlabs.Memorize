# Memorize Activity Flatpak

Memorize is about finding matching pairs. A pair can be images, sounds and text and this could be extended to animations or movie snippets as well. Which pairs match is up to the creator of the game. Memorize is more than a predefined game you can play, it allows you to create new games yourself as well.
